## Interfaces and Inheritance

#### `@override`注解
 @Override annotation informs the compiler that the element is meant to override an element declared in a superclass. 
 Overriding methods will be discussed in Interfaces and Inheritance.  
 While it is not required to use this annotation when overriding a method, it helps to prevent errors. If a method marked with @Override fails to correctly override a method in one of its superclasses, 
 the compiler generates an error.
 注解很大一部分作用是给编译器提供信息，让编译器能够提前报错
